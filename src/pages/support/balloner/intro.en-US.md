## About the game

This is the first game launched by YGeeker. We hope that people can relax their body and mind by playing such a small game. You can temporarily stay away from the bustling city life and let your soul fly to the blue sky with the balloon.

## Suggestions

Although the game is so attractive, please arrange your entertainment time reasonably. We hope that after you relax in the game, you can return to life and work with full enthusiasm. Just like YGeekerâ€™s philosophy: Technology and life coexist harmoniously.
